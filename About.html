    I’m currently a western software student, and along with my stuies, I enjoy spending time with my pets—a friendly golden retriever named Honey, a curious cat named Gracie, and a betta fish that adds a calm presence to my space. Throughout the years, I’ve tried my hand at various sports like soccer, frisbee, basketball (though I’ll admit, basketball isn’t my strongest suit), and hockey, which has always been a favorite.
    Music has also been a big part of my life; I’ve been in both choir and band, playing the trumpet during my time in band. When I’m not busy with school or other activities, I love immersing myself in a good book or diving into creative projects, especially in art. It’s a great way to balance my technical side with something more expressive.
